# Search for Issues or Merge Requests

When you see a reference like `JIRA:Something`, `GITHUB:Something`, or `GITLAB:Something`, you should search the appropriate provider for the issue or merge request to help resolve the conversation. 

For example:
- `JIRA:PR-1212` should search on JIRA to know more about the ticket with ID `PR-1212`.
- `GITHUB:1234` should search on GitHub, to know more about the issue or pull request with ID `1234`.
- `GITLAB:5678` should search on GitLab to know more about the issue or merge request with ID `5678`.

 these should act like little link to external data where you can search to have more information about the context of the conversation.

Please use the appropriate tools and APIs provided by JIRA, GitHub, or GitLab to fetch the relevant information.
